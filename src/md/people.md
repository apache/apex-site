# People

The community is comprised of the PMC, Committers and Contributors. The PMC (project management committee) is a committee of the Apache Software Foundation charged with responsibility for a top level project. Committers have direct access to the source of a project and actively evolve the code-base. Contributors improve the project in various ways such as submission of patches, improving documentation, testing the product and by providing suggestions to the Committers. The number of Contributors to the project is unbounded. Get involved today. All contributions to the project are greatly appreciated. For more details, please see [contributing guidelines](contributing.html).

## Becoming a committer

Community members that make sustained, welcome contributions to the project may be invited to become a committer. Committers are voted in by the PMC. A committer has a signed Contributor License Agreement (CLA) on file and an apache.org address.

We expect committers to subscribe to the project mailing lists.

A committer will be considered “emeritus/inactive” by not contributing in any form to the project for over 1 year. An emeritus committer may request reinstatement of commit access from the PMC. Such reinstatement is subject to lazy consensus of active PMC members.

The Project Management Committee (PMC) is responsible for the oversight of the project and it also decides who to add as a PMC member. Existing committers may be invited to become a PMC member after consistent contribution and activity over a period of time and participation in directional and community building discussions.
